# Introduction
`TypeConfuseDelegate` is a gadget chain take advantage of `SortedSet` class calls the **comparator** class to sort while deserializing, which is an input that attacker can controls and **multicast delegate** can modify the characteristics of delegate instance to trigger code execution during deserialization process.

In this blog, we will have 2 main sections:
- First is about `SortedSet` class and how it can be used as a gadget chain
- Second is about how `MulticastDelegate` is used to help trigger code execution and why this gadget is named `TypeConfuseDelegate`

## 1. About SortedSet class

In its simplest form, `SortedSet` take a comparator as an input, and then you call `Add` to add elements that you want to compare to sort

```c#
// Create a sorted set using the ByFileExtension comparer.
var set = new SortedSet<string>(new ByFileExtension());
set.Add("hello.a");
set.Add("hello.b");
```
In the code above, `ByFileExtension` is a comparator which is inherited from `IComparer<T>` interface

In this interface, it defines a method `int Compare(T x, T y)` . This method is used to compare 2 objects that have the same Type.

When we call `Add(T x)` for the first time, the comparator won't be called, **only after the second call to `Add(T x)`, the comparator will be called** ( gotta need something to compare with right ? :D )

### Comparer class and ComparisonComparer type
`Compaerer<T>` implements `ICompare<T>` interface, in this class, we will focus on `Comparer.Create()` function because that is we want to create a comparator as an input for `SortedSet` class

Comparer<T> source code:

`Comparer.Create()` returns a `ComparisonComparer<T>` type

As you can see, `ComparisonComparer<T>` implements `Serializable` attribute and it inherited from `Comparer<T>` class, so in here we have a class that:
 - Can be serialized
 - Is a comparator, which can be used as an input for `SortedSet` object
 
Please take note of this class as it will become very important for our gadget chain.
 
We will focus on the function that it uses to compare:
 ```c#
 public override int Compare(T x, T y)
 {
    return this._comparison(x,y);
 }

 ```
Where `this._comparison` has a type `Compasion<T>`  and the type is passed in at initilization time. Let's take a deeper look at `Comparison<T>` type
```c#
 public delegate int Comparison<in T>(T x, T y);
```
Its function signature is the same as `Comparison` function and method in `IComparer<T>` interface.

### Sortedset OnDeserialization callback

`IDeserializationCallback` interface defined `OnDeserialization` method which is automatically called during deserialization process, it's like **magic method** 

In `SortedSet.OnDeserialization()` implementation, we can see:
- It extracts a type named `Comparer` with the type `IComparer<T>`
- It extracts our input when we call `Add(input)` in `GetValues("Items")` 

So during deserialization process, when `SortedSet<T>` trigger sort, it will call the **comparison function in the comparator** after we call `Add` more than 2 times.

**Idea to craft RCE payload**:

Because we can control the comparison function input, we can also control the elements that we want to `Add()`. If we can set the comparison function to `Process.Start()` . We can achieve code execution

```c#
public static Process Start(string fileName, string arguments)
{
	 return Process.Start(new ProcessStartInfo(fileName, arguments));
}
```

`Process.Start()` function return `Process` type, if we replace comparison function with `Process.Start()` function, it will throw error and cause serialization failure

So how do we overcome this problem ?. Turn out, we can replace the calling function with a `MulticastDelegate`. 

## 2. About MulticastDelegate to TypeConfuseDelegate gadget chain

Here is the code that use `MulticastDelegate` as an input for `SortedSet` class.

Let's break it down to see what's the magic behind all this:

`MulticastDelegate` is a multicast delegation, there are 2 types of **delegate** in C#: Single and Multicast

In here, we call `MulticastDelegate.Combine()` , it will merge all the delegates with the same type into 1 delegate instance ( see more [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/delegates/how-to-combine-delegates-multicast-delegates)). When the multicast delegate is called, it invokes the delegates in the list, in order.
