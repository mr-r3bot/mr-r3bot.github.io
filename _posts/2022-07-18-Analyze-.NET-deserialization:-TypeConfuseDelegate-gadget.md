# Introduction
`TypeConfuseDelegate` is a gadget chain take advantage of `SortedSet` class calls the **comparator** class to sort while deserializing, which is an input that attacker can controls and **multicast delegate** can modify the characteristics of delegate instance to trigger code execution during deserialization process.

In this blog, we will have 2 main sections:
- First is about `SortedSet` class and how it can be used as a gadget chain
- Second is about how `MulticastDelegate` is used to help trigger code execution and why this gadget is named `TypeConfuseDelegate`

## 1. About SortedSet class

In its simplest form, `SortedSet` take a comparator as an input, and then you call `Add` to add elements that you want to compare to sort

```c#
// Create a sorted set using the ByFileExtension comparer.
var set = new SortedSet<string>(new ByFileExtension());
set.Add("hello.a");
set.Add("hello.b");
```
In the code above, `ByFileExtension` is a comparator which is inherited from `IComparer<T>` interface

In this interface, it defines a method `int Compare(T x, T y)` . This method is used to compare 2 objects that have the same Type.

When we call `Add(T x)` for the first time, the comparator won't be called, **only after the second call to `Add(T x)`, the comparator will be called** ( gotta need something to compare with right ? :D )

### 1.1 Comparer class and ComparisonComparer type
`Compaerer<T>` implements `ICompare<T>` interface, in this class, we will focus on `Comparer.Create()` function because that is how we want create a comparator as an input for `SortedSet` class

*Comparer<T> source code*:

`Comparer.Create()` returns a `ComparisonComparer<T>` type

 As you can see, `ComparisonComparer<T>` implements `Serializable` attribute and it inherited from `Comparer<T>` class, so in here we have a class that:
  - Can be serialized
  - Is a comparator, which can be used as an input for `SortedSet` object
 
 Please take note of this class as it will become very important for our gadget chain.
 
 We will focus on the function that it uses to compare:
 ```c#
 public override int Compare(T x, T y)
 {
    return this._comparison(x,y);
 }
 ```
Where `this._comparison` has a type `Compasion<T>`  and the type is passed in at initilization time. Let's take a deeper look at `Comparison<T>` type
```c#
 public delegate int Comparison<in T>(T x, T y);
```
Its function signature is the same as `Comparison` function and method in `IComparer<T>` interface.
