## Introduction
`TypeConfuseDelegate` is a gadget chain take advantage of `SortedSet` class calls the **comparator** class to sort while deserializing, which is an input that attacker can controls and **multicast delegate** can modify the characteristics of delegateinstance to trigger code execution during deserialization process.
